## Print Hello World!

The `alert()` function will display text in a dialog box that pops up on the screen.

The `document.write()` method is mostly used for testing purpose. If it is used after an HTML document is fully loaded, it will delete all existing HTML.

The `console. log()` method writes a message to the console. The console is useful for testing purposes. When testing this method, be sure to have the console view visible (press `Ctrl+Shift+J`).


### Source Code

```javascript

// Print Hello World

alert("Hello World!");

document.write("Hello World!");

Console.log("Hello World!");

In this program, we have used the built-in `console.log()` function to print the string `Hello world!` on our screen.
